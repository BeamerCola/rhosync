rhoSync
</p>
<p>
rhoSync is a Ruby-based framework to access data from various backend
applications and sync them to remote devices. Specifically it is a Ruby on
Rails application that allows managing backend application sources and user
subscriptions to those data sources. It is optimized for delivery of
ongoing incremental updates of those data sources to users accessing that
data via mobile devices.
</p>
<p>
SYSTEM INSTALLATION AND USAGE
</p>
<p>
PREREQUISITES
</p>
<pre>
    * Ruby on Rails Version 2.1
    * mySQL (or other relational database that plays nicely with Rails)
</pre>
<p>
ADMINISTRATION
</p>
<pre>
    * install the Rails application files (generally by unzipping)
    * set up the database, generally by running “rake db:migrate”
</pre>
<p>
SET UP A BACKEND DATA SOURCE
</p>
<pre>
    * we ship with a few Sources out of the box (such as SugarCRM and SalesForce).
    * These are delivered as Yaml files that should execute when you run the migrations. The Ruby code to interact with the backends is populated into those source records
    * Edit the “login”, “password” and “URL” fields if you are using one of the existing sources
    * Otherwise create a new Source from the application main menu and edit those same fields.
    * If you are using another backend you may need to create “prolog”, “call”, “epilog” and “sync” fields with the appropriate code. See “Creating a Rhosync Datasource”
</pre>
<p>
HOW IT WORKS
</p>
<p>
rhoSync normalizes all backend application data into a common server-based
relational schema, in preparation for delivering the further downstream,
generally to mobile devices.
</p>
<p>
Specifically the “master server data table” is a “property bag”
model, which keeps track of data sources, individual objects and the
name/value pairs for those objects. This allows handling of diverse backend
application data structures within a single master store. It also provides
for efficient delivery of single “fields” of data in either direction
(e.g. just the status changing of a trouble ticket).
</p>
<p>
The connection code for logging into a backend application (via REST or
SOAP APIs), calling the data retrieval and update functions, logging off,
and populating the master data table are each written in Ruby but stored in
the application sources table. The schema for this table and other tables
involved in supporting this functionality are as described below. DATABASE
SCHEMA
</p>
<p>
There are two important tables that describe fully the universe of data
sources and their contents for downstream syncing. These are the SOURCES
table and the OBJECT_VALUES table (and the corresponding <a
href="../../classes/Source.html">Source</a> and ObjectValues models. Other
tables include tables to keep of the mobile device users and their
subscriptions to the various data sources available. OBJECT_VALUES A
“property bag” schema that facilitatest importing any kind of data into
a common table for later distribution to downstream clients.
</p>
<pre>
    * object – the unique identifier of the object (generally an integer “record ID” from the backend system)
    * attribute – the name of the attribute (e.g. “Account Name”, “Industry”)
    * value – the value of the attribute (e.g. “Acme Corp”, “software”)
    * source_id – reference back to the source (see below) used for syncing
</pre>
<p>
SOURCES This table contains all of the information necessary to connect to
a given backend system. These includes the URL to connect to and
authentication information.
</p>
<pre>
    * URL – the URL to connect to (for REST adapters) or the URL to the WSDL (for SOAP services)
    * SERVER – OPTIONAL a logical name for the data source server (AcmeCorpSugar)
    * LOGIN – the username or logon ID for the backend
    * PASSWORD – password (stored in the clear right now) for the backend system
</pre>
<p>
Backend Code Columns
</p>
<pre>
    * PROLOG – a set of Ruby code generally for logging into the backend system. Generally this is a SOAP or REST call which populates a session_id variable (that variable must be used in the call code below).
    * CALL – the actual code for getting data back (generally uses the session_id acquired in the prolog)
    * LOGOUT – OPTIONAL, code to logoff the backend system
    * SYNC – this is the code used to take apart the returned data and stuff it into the OBJECT_VALUES property bag table. Theoretically this could be done in the CALL column.
</pre>
<p>
SUBSCRIPTIONS This table keeps track of user and the data sources that they
are subscribed to.
</p>
<pre>
    * SOURCE_ID – joins to the specific data source subscribed to in the SOURCES table
    * USER_ID – joins to the user in the USERS table
    * QUERY – a set of name/value pairs that can be used to subset the data
    * LASTSYNC – time of last successful sync of user to the master store
</pre>
<p>
USERS This table is primarily used by the sync subscription code to allow
joining from subscription status to a specifically identified user
</p>
<pre>
    * userid – the symbolic ID of this user for rhoSync in general (not necessarily for all backend systems)
    * firstname
    * lastname
    * status
</pre>
